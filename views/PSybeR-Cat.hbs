    <h3>Background</h3>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Many species in animal kingdom moves dynamically in their natural habitat. The
        diversity in the motion skills present in a single species is vast and highly refined than what technology have
        achieved
        so far. Versatility and agility are the two main characteristics that defines the motion of an animal. Eckert
        and Ijspeert (2018) defined agility as follow “Agility is representing a previously acquired and
        size dependent set of locomotion skills, executed in a precise, fast and ideally reflexive manner to an outside
        stimulus”.
        Today, most of the locomotive machines are either using wheels or tracks for travelling. However, the problem of
        using such means of locomotion is that they cannot travel on an uneven terrain and
        cannot avoid obstacles efficiently. A better way to travel on land for a machine is by using leg mechanisms, as
        they can walk or run on any terrain, jump over the obstacles or even climb on highly
        steep hills.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Machines with relatively simple mechanisms (such as wheeled or tracked) are
        insufficient to travel in difficult terrains. Whereas, legged robots are highly adaptable
        to move on uneven and difficult terrains. The Bipedal robots (two-Legged) and
        Quadruped robots (four-legged) have wider applications in industries as they are highly
        agile and have flexible applications. Quadrupedal robots have shown better results
        when compared with the Bipedal robots. This can be attributed to its four legs that
        provides low centre of gravity, stability, and ability to lift heavy loads.
        Building a simple robot is itself an overwhelming task. Designing a robot with complex
        four-legged mechanism is even more daunting task. One way to design such an agile
        robot is to first look deep into the nature. Nature has plenty of examples for us to
        observe. Researchers around the world have always been fascinated by nature and
        tried to reproduce its elegant designs into mechanical systems. Some researchers have
        tried to replicate the walking gait of a quadrupedal animal using hydraulics actuators,
        some have tried using pneumatic actuators, while some have even tried using
        solenoids. In this paper, we have tried to build a quadrupedal robot using servo motors.
        Servo motors are cheap and easily available in the market, hence can be used by many
        to try and build their own project for research purposes.

    We analyzed various section of the robot’s chassis in SolidWorks by taking a
    reference load of 20kg load which were prone to failure.

    <h3>Fabrication</h3>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        We have used Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) for manufacturing.
        FDM 3D printing is the most cost-effective way of producing
        custom thermoplastic parts and the most widely used for rapid
        prototyping among various industries. The following were the
        printer parameters:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Nozzle Temp: 210&#8451</li>
            <li>Bed Temperature: 60&#8451</li>
            <li>Layer Height: 0.2 mm</li>
            <li>Nozzle Diameter: 0.4 mm</li>
            <li>Material: PLA+</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>The Quadruped robots (four-legged) has been
                successfully designed using servo motors.</li>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">PSybeR Cat is my mechanical engineering final year project. It
            is a
            12 degree of freedom quadruped robot. I built this by getting inspired by Boston Dynamic's Spot Robot dog
            and
            MIT's Cheetah Robot.</p>

            <p class="card-text" style="padding: 10px;">I have actually built two versions of the quadruped robot. The
                version 1.0 was not able
                to stand on its feet
                without getting an external support. The weight and size of that robot was primarily the main problem.
                Secondly,
                version 1.0 was not maintenance friendly</p>
